LangChain RAG Project
Introduction

This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project implemented using Python and LangChain. The goal of this project is to enhance natural language generation by retrieving relevant data from external sources and using it to produce accurate, context-aware responses.

Project Overview

Data Ingestion: Raw data (text, XML, PDF) is processed and loaded using custom scripts.

Document Loading: Text files are converted into structured documents for indexing.

RAG Pipeline: Combines a retrieval system with a language model to answer queries based on the ingested data.

Key Libraries:

LangChain for RAG pipeline

Python for scripting and data processing

NumPy and Pandas (minimal) for data handling
